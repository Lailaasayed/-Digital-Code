# -Digital-Code
develop python code to To facilitate the process of collecting data daily through various platforms, just download the data from the platform and the code will clean it, extract useful information from it, and place it in a new columns, in addition to collecting and arranging the data in one file. 

### For example
If you download a file containing campaigns information for a given month through diffrent Platforms like Meta, Snapchat, Google, and Twitter
